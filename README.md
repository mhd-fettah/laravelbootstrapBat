# laravel-bootstrap bat
the plan is to create bat file that 
- you just clone 
- run it 
- the bat will install laravel 
- copy env
- help you fill the new env
- intall bootstrap
- include it in the project with mix
- create a read me file that explain the installation process 
- commit the final laravel code to the git .

## problems 
- now the process halt with no errors from time to time at some steps .
